      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2 class="intro-header">Why do I hate C++?</h2>
      <p>
        I myself have used a lot of programming in my life, but one thing that I
        really hate the most is <em>C++</em>. Out of all the languages that I
        have tried, this is the one that gave me the most headaches. Every time
        I see those angle brackets, semicolons, and long error messages, parang
        gusto ko nalang <em>isara yung laptop ko</em>. It feels overwhelming at
        first glance, especially when you compare it to other languages that
        look much cleaner.

      <!-- Body -->
      <h2 class="body-header">An abomination?</h2>
      <p>
        C++ is just an <em>abomination</em>, if someone who is new to
        programming and tries to learn it they will for sure crash out, why you
        may ask? First is logic, most likely if someone is new to programming
        they are new to logic, if you pair that with C++’s syntax it is going to
        be so frustrating. Imagine trying to understand how loops, conditions,
        and functions work while also worrying about curly braces, data types,
        header files, and confusing compiler errors. Isang maliit na typo lang,
        <em>sira na agad yung buong program mo</em>. Sometimes the error message
        is even harder to understand than the code itself. It feels like C++ is
        not beginner friendly at all, parang it demands discipline and attention
        to detail from the very start.
      </p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <h2>Respect the backbone</h2>
      <p>
        But here’s the thing, C++ is the
        <em>backbone of every technology that we use everyday</em>, from basic
        applications to embedded systems and operating systems. Yes, it is true
        that it’s hard to learn C++ but if you have the dedication and drive it
        is going to be fun and exciting. The more you understand it, the more
        you start to appreciate how powerful it really is. You begin to see why
        it is used in game engines, operating systems, and high performance
        applications. Kahit mahirap siya, there is something satisfying about
        finally making your program run without errors. Maybe C++ is not
        something to hate, but something that
        <em>challenges you to grow as a programmer</em>.

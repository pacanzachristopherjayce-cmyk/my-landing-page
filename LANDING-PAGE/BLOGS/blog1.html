        <h1>A programming language that powers every technology in the world</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I myself have used a lot of programming in my life, but one thing that I really hate the most is C++.</p> 
            <p>C++ is just an abomination, if someone who is new to programming and tries to learn it they will for sure crash out, why you may ask? First is logic, most likely if someone is new to programming they are new to logic, if you pair that with C++’s syntax it is going to be so frustrating.</p> <p>But here’s the thing, C++ is the backbone of every technology that we use everyday, from basic applications to embedded systems and operating systems. Yes, it is true that it’s hard to learn C++ but if you have the dedication and drive it is going to be fun and exciting.

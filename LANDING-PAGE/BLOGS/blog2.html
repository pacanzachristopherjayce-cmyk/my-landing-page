        <h1>Sira na ang utak ko dahil sa instagram reels</h1>

                <!-- Introduction -->
        <h2 class="intro-header">One more reel</h2>
        <p>
          "<em>Isapang reel!</em> Maybe the next reel is going to be more funny or interesting!"
          For those who use instagram reels like me everyday we experience this feeling
          every time we use it, parang it feels like naka "glue" yung mata sa screen ng
          phone mo. Minsan hindi mo namamalayan na ilang minuto na pala ang lumipas,
          kasi sobrang dali lang mag swipe pataas. Parang automatic na yung kamay mo
          kahit wala ka namang specific na hinahanap. You tell yourself na saglit lang,
          pampalipas oras lang, pero bago mo mapansin naka ilang reels ka na pala.
          It becomes part of your daily routine without you even realizing it, <em>without you even realizing it</em>.
        </p>

        <!-- Body -->
        <h2 class="body-header">Ok pa ba ako?</h2>
        <p>
          For those who use instagram reels everyday for more than 1 hr, tingin nyo ba,
          <em>ok pa ba kayo?</em> In my own experience instagram reels is very addicting, most of
          the time pag na nonood ako ng reels, 2 hrs feels like 5 mins, time flies by
          really fast. Not only that ig reels is addicting, it also ruined my attention
          span so bad that I can't focus pag nag lelecture yung mga professors ko. It also
          destroys our mental health, with content changing every three to thiry seconds,
          you experience sudden change in mood, if you use it like lets say for 5 hours,
          after that ma de deppress ka, mapapatanong ka nalang sa sarili mo na bakit ka
          bigla na depress. Napapansin ko din na mas nagiging impatient ako sa mga bagay
          na mabagal, like reading books or watching long educational videos. Parang
          nasanay na yung utak ko sa mabilisang entertainment. Kahit gusto kong mag
          focus sa school works ko, may urge pa rin na i-check yung phone ko. It slowly
          affects productivity, sleep schedule, and even motivation to do important
          tasks. Sometimes you feel guilty after using it for too long, but the next day
          you still end up doing the same thing again, <em>doing the same thing again</em>.
        </p>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <h2>Balance is the key</h2>
        <p>
          So far, what I really think na kailangan ko gawin is to balance using it every
          day. Like for example, limiting to only using it for 30 mins everyday. Yes this
          is hard, especially if this is your first time limiting yourself using ig
          reels, but always asks yourself, <em>ok pa ba ako?</em> Maybe setting small rules for
          myself like not using it before studying or before sleeping can help. It does
          not mean completely removing it from my life, but learning how to control it.
          At the end of the day, <em>technology should help us and not control us</em>. If we are
          aware of our habits and slowly adjust them, maybe we can enjoy reels without
          sacrificing our focus, mental health, and personal growth.

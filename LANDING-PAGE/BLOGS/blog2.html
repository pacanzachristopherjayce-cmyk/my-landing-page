    <h1>Sira na ang utak ko dahil sa instagram reels</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h2 class="intro-header">One more reel</h2>
    <p>
      "Isapang reel! Maybe the next reel is going to be more funny or interesting!"
      For those who use instagram reels like me everyday we experience this feeling
      every time we use it, parang it feels like naka "glue" yung mata sa screen ng
      phone mo.
    </p>

    <!-- Body -->
    <h2 class="body-header">Ok pa ba ako?</h2>
    <p>
      For those who use instagram reels everyday for more than 1 hr, tingin nyo ba,
      ok pa ba kayo? In my own experience instagram reels is very addicting, most of
      the time pag na nonood ako ng reels, 2 hrs feels like 5 mins, time flies by
      really fast. Not only that ig reels is addicting, it also ruined my attention
      span so bad that I can't focus pag nag lelecture yung mga professors ko. It also
      destroys our mental health, with content changing every three to thiry seconds,
      you experience sudden change in mood, if you use it like lets say for 5 hours,
      after that ma de deppress ka, mapapatanong ka nalang sa sarili mo na bakit ka
      bigla na depress.
    </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h2>Balance is the key</h2>
    <p>
      So far, what I really think na kailangan ko gawin is to balance using it every
      day. Like for example, limiting to only using it for 30 mins everyday. Yes this
      is hard, especially if this is your first time limiting yourself using ig
      reels, but always asks yourself, ok pa ba ako?

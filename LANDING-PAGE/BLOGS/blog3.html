        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h2>Build more, read less</h2>
          <p>What if the best way to learn programming is not by reading more notes, but by actually <em class="highlight">building something and watching it break?</em> As a Computer Science student, na realize ko na I learn more when I create projects, even small and imperfect ones. That is why I started building Python projects. This blog is about how I am starting out, what I am working toward, and why these small projects matter to my future in IT.</p>
        
        <!-- Body -->
        <h2 class="body-header">Starting with Python Projects</h2>
            <p>Nagsisimula palang ako, so my Python projects are simple. Some focus on logic, some on basic systems, and some on problem solving. These projects help me understand how ideas turn into working programs. I do not aim for perfect projects. What matters to me is learning how to think, debug, and improve my code.</p>
      
          <p>I <strong>hate</strong> designing, so my main goal is to become a backend developer. I enjoy working on the logic and structure behind applications more than the visual side. Python is a good starting point for this path because it is widely used in backend systems.</p>
        
        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <h2>Every progress matters</h2>
        <p>Right now, my focus is simple. <em class="highlight">Keep building Python projects and keep learning</em>. As a CS student, I know that progress takes time. Starting small is not a weakness, it is the first step toward becoming a backend developer.</p>

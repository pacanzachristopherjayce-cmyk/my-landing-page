      <!-- Childhood -->
      <h2 class="intro-header" id="childhood">Childhood days</h2>
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup> My experiences during my childhood mostly happened in
        <b>Bohol</b>, my province. <sup>2</sup> During this time I was living
        with my mother while my dad was in Manila. <sup>3</sup> Nothing really
        happened that much when I was still in kindergarten here in my province.
        <sup>4</sup> Most days were simple, and everything felt slow and quiet.
        <sup>5</sup> After six years I was sent here to Manila to continue
        studying. <sup>6</sup> During my first week here in Manila, when I was
        still in elementary school, I was really nervous because of the
        environment. <sup>7</sup> It was new to me, and I didn’t know what to
        expect. <sup>8</sup> The surroundings felt louder and busier than what I
        was used to in Bohol. <sup>9</sup> After some time I made new friends,
        and I was finally confident in my environment. <sup>10</sup> I slowly
        got used to the city and the people around me. <sup>11</sup> During my
        elementary days I made a lot of new friends. <sup>12</sup> We played
        some games both offline and online almost every day. <sup>13</sup> We
        also talked and laughed at each other a lot. <sup>14</sup> Those small
        moments made school more fun for me. <sup>15</sup> One of my memorable
        experiences that I can also remember is when I was in grade 6.
        <sup>16</sup> In that year, our family mostly went out of town during
        holidays. <sup>17</sup> We went to different places in northern
        <i>Luzon</i>, Baguio, Sagada, Banaue, and other places.
        <sup>18</sup> Each trip felt exciting because I wasn’t used to traveling
        that far. <sup>19</sup> I <u>remember</u> the long drives, the cold
        weather, and the beautiful views. <sup>20</sup> Thosse moments became
        some of the happiest memories of that year.

      <!-- Teenage -->
      <h2 class="body-header" id="teenage">Teenage years</h2>
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And finally my teenage years being a teenager was really
        <em>new</em> to me. <sup>2</sup> Everything felt different compared to
        when I was younger. <sup>3</sup> First I gained a lot of
        responsibilities, like managing my documents, thinking about what I want
        to do later in life, and so much more. <sup>4</sup> These
        responsibilities slowly piled up as I got older. <sup>5</sup> Managing
        my documents wasn’t my responsibility during my childhood days.
        <sup>6</sup> Now I manage them every time I send an application.
        <sup>7</sup> This includes transferring to another school or submitting
        documents requested by my teacher. <sup>8</sup> Sometimes I even have to
        check if they are complete or if something is missing. <sup>9</sup> I
        also have to make sure I submit them on time. <sup>10</sup> Thinking
        about what I want to do later in life is probably the hardest part of my
        teenage years. <sup>11</sup> This situation feels uncomfortable because
        there are too many possibilities. <sup>12</sup> I often do not know
        which path is right for me. <sup>13</sup> The reason this is difficult
        is because I was in my comfort zone during those times. <sup>14</sup> I
        was not used to stepping out of that comfort zone. <sup>15</sup> During
        this period I was also in high school. <sup>16</sup> My high school
        years were similar to my elementary days. <sup>17</sup> I got to play
        with my friends, laugh, and talk with them often. <sup>18</sup> We had
        fun during breaks and joked around like before. <sup>19</sup> The only
        real difference was the amount of <strong>responsibilities</strong> I
        had to deal with. <sup>20</sup> That is why my teenage years became a
        mix of comfort and challenge.

      <!-- College -->
      <h2 id="college">College years</h2>
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Lastly, my college days started from my first year and
        continue up to now which is my second year. <sup>2</sup> A lot of people
        feel nervous and anxious when they are freshmen in college.
        <sup>3</sup> I felt curious and anxious because during the pandemic I
        was homeschooled. <sup>4</sup> When I was homeschooled I did not have
        classmates or friends to talk to. <sup>5</sup> The only people I could
        talk to were my relatives and family members. <sup>6</sup> Most of the
        time I stayed inside the house doing my activities. <sup>7</sup> I was
        no longer used to interacting with people my age. <sup>8</sup> When
        college started I did not know how to make friends anymore compared to
        high school. <sup>9</sup> It felt strange to suddenly be surrounded by
        many students again. <sup>10</sup> I did not know how to start
        conversations or approach other people. <sup>11</sup> After a couple of
        weeks I was thankful that I made new friends. <sup>12</sup> Up to now in
        my second year they are still my friends. <sup>13</sup> We slowly got to
        know each other through group activities and small talks.
        <sup>14</sup> They were easy to get along with which helped me adjust.
        <sup>15</sup> At present I am enjoying what I am doing in college.
        <sup>16</sup> I get to learn new things and explore what I want to do
        after college. <sup>17</sup> I also understand more about the course
        that I am taking. <sup>18</sup> Sometimes college life becomes stressful
        but it is still manageable for me. <sup>19</sup> I also get
        opportunities to go to other places because of school requirements or
        group work. <sup>20</sup> Overall, my college days are shaping the kind
        of person I want to become.

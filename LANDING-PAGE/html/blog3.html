      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2 id="introduction">Build more, read less</h2>
      <p>
        What if the best way to learn programming is not by reading more notes,
        but by actually
        <em class="highlight">building something and watching it break?</em> As
        a Computer Science student, na realize ko na I learn more when I create
        projects, even small and imperfect ones. That is why I started building
        Python projects. This blog is about how I am starting out, what I am
        working toward, and why these small projects matter to my future in IT.
        Instead of waiting until I feel “ready,” I decided to just start. Kahit
        simple calculator lang or small logic-based programs, each one teaches
        me something new. I began to understand that learning happens more when
        I struggle with errors than when I just read about concepts. Sometimes
        breaking the code is actually part of the process, because
        <em>errors force me to think deeper</em>. For me, learning programming
        is not about consuming information, it is about
        <em>actively creating and experimenting</em>.

      <!-- Body -->
      <h2 class="body-header" id="body">Starting with Python Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Nagsisimula palang ako, so my Python projects are simple. Some focus on
        logic, some on basic systems, and some on problem solving. These
        projects help me understand how ideas turn into working programs. I do
        not aim for perfect projects. What matters to me is learning how to
        think, debug, and improve my code. Every small bug that I fix builds my
        confidence little by little. I am slowly training myself to break down
        problems before coding them. Minsan matagal bago ko ma solve yung isang
        problem, but that process teaches me patience. I realized that
        <em>consistency is more important than complexity</em>. Even simple
        projects can become powerful learning experiences if I take them
        seriously and reflect on what I learned. At the end of the day,
        <em>progress is built through repetition and practice</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I <strong>hate</strong> designing, so my main goal is to become a
        backend developer. I enjoy working on the logic and structure behind
        applications more than the visual side. Python is a good starting point
        for this path because it is widely used in backend systems. I like the
        feeling of organizing data, creating functions, and making systems work
        behind the scenes. Designing layouts and choosing colors is not
        something that excites me. Mas gusto ko yung part na nag iisip kung
        paano gagana yung system internally. Backend development feels like
        solving a big puzzle where every piece must connect properly. That is
        why I am focusing my energy on strengthening my logic and programming
        fundamentals. For me,
        <em>mastering the backend means mastering how systems think</em>, and
        that challenge motivates me. I believe that if I stay consistent,
        <em>I can slowly shape myself into the developer I want to become</em>.

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <h2 id="conclusion">Every progress matters</h2>
      <p>
        Right now, my focus is simple.
        <em class="highlight"
          >Keep building Python projects and keep learning</em
        >. As a CS student, I know that progress takes time. Starting small is
        not a weakness, it is the first step toward becoming a backend
        developer. I do not need to rush the process or compare myself to
        others. What matters is that I am improving compared to who I was
        yesterday. Kahit maliit na improvement lang bawat araw, malaking bagay
        na yun in the long run. I trust that consistent effort will compound
        over time. Programming is a long journey, and I am just at the
        beginning. What keeps me going is the mindset that
        <em>every line of code I write makes me better</em>. Because in the end,
        <em>every progress matters</em>.
